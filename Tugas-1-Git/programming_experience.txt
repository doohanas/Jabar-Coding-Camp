----- PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCES -----

**** My First Learning Programming by reading a book ****

My first experience to learn programming by reading a book. The title is "Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics" writteny by Jennifer Robbins.
I learn by my self on May 2021. I learn about basic HTML5, CSS3, and JS. I had finished read this book for a month. Then, i make my first website about my girlfriends. Honesty, it was not to impressed her, i just
want to make my first project is simple and easy.

**** Join My First Bootcamp in Kotakode x Progate ****

For the next, i was joined my first bootcamp in Kotakode x Progate for a month. It was still the same, i learn by myself. I learn in progate via online in its website. I learn a lot about JavaScript.
For the first time it was absolutely challenging me but my curiousity was high. So, i learnt the best that i could. 

After a month, i build my first project to build a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was excited to create my own calculator. Finally, i was so happy, because my project had done.

**** Learning in Skilvul.com & Join Binus Bootcamp x Progate ****

I still curious and i want to improve my programming skill. Then, i was joined in Binus Bootcamp x Progate to learn Git, Command line, HTML, CSS, and JS. So, i was confused about the terminal. It was liked
the hacker movie that i ever watched. I was bad to use terminal, comman line and git. Because i never touch or open this app before. But the easiest way to boost my skills by watching the tutorial in YouTube.
So, it was helpful, really helpful. And i am used to using git and command line for every project.

For learning in skilvul i just learnt about HTML, CSS, Basic JavaScript and ES6. It was a new things that i found. I found a lot of method like map, forEach, filter, shift, unshift, pop, push, etc.
I also learned about an object, array, asynchronous and synchronous, class, function, etc. It makes me a headache for that moment. But i stil going on to learn. After finished the task from skilvu, 
i got 4 certificates.
